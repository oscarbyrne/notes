A huge barren wetland marking the Northern frontier of [[Central Empire]].

Because of the landscape and lack of wind the region has been mostly unexplored. What lies beyond is unknown.

In ancient times, it was ruled by a powerful necromancer from which the region gets its name. He is responsible for the numerous [[ziggurat]]s that dot the landscape.

Today, thanks to the advent of [[steam power]], the region is beginning to be mapped.
