Since records began, the [[Central Empire]] has waged war on the [[Hololonoi]].

For 500 years Empire engineers (and [[Hololonoi]] slaves) have been building the so-called [[Great Wall]] which they say will stretch from the [[Western Range]] to the [[Eastern Ocean]]. They're on good track and expect to complete it some time next millennium.
