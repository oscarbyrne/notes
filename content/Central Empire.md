To the west is the [[Western Range]].
To the north is [[Keth]]
To the east is the [[Eastern Ocean]].
To the south is the [[Hololonoi]].

The crown jewel of the Empire is the temple city [[Justin]], where the bureaucracy administers a never-ending ceremonial dance at the center of which is the Emperor.
