Built by the powerful (and lonely) necromancer [[Keth]]. Their purpose is unknown, maybe he was just looking for something to do.

Since the advent of [[steam power]] so many ziggurats have been discovered in [[Keth]] that a systematic naming convention has been adopted:

Ziggurats are now designated by a letter code indicating the class of ziggurat, followed by the year of its discovery and finally a number indicating the order of its discovery.

Notable ziggurats:
- [[Ziggurat LT 4422-1]]
- [[Ziggurat GT 4501-2]]
