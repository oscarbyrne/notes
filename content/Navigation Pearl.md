A magical device, often inlaid into a necklace, which acts as a repository of mental maps.

The device will absorb the mental map of anyone who wears it. Any subsequent wearer can access those memories as if their own.

Used by the [[Forward Transit Company]] as part of its franchisee training program. The mental map shared in this way is considered intellectual property of the [[Forward Transit Company]] and franchisees are expected to sign a non-competition clause on induction.
